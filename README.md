# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Objectives
This analysis aims to observe which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to see general trends that may aid us in model selection and hyper parameter selection. The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant. To achieve this i have used machine learning classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input.

Steps:
Import Libraries
Pandas for Data Manipulation import pandas as pd

Numpy for Data import numpy as np

Matplotlib and Seaborn for Data Visualisation import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns

Scikit learn for different Metric, Model Selection and Classification Models

Classifiers Used for prediction Comparision:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Navie Bayes Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
Import Dataset
The data has been obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/. If you are interested in the social impact data can bring about, you must definitely check out their work. The Dataset is also available in this repository in the data folder.

Data VisualiZation using Matplotlib and Seaborn
Exploring the dataset
Density and Hist plots
Handling Missing Values
Feature Selection
Correlation between the dependent and independent features using "Correlation Matrix"
Comparing the p-values of the features and find the importance of the features
Splitting the dataset into Train and Test set
Using sklearn library train_test_split
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

Create Baseline model on the Training set
Used KFold cross validation for train the data for different train and test sets
Evalution of Algorithms on Standardised Data
Created Pipeline for first Scaling the data and then training the data different classification models
Hyperparameter Tuning - Tuning SVM
Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning of SVM model.
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

Application of SVM on dataset
Fitting the SVM model using the dataset
Predicting the Test set results
Predicting the test set results using .predict and comparing the results with the actual values
Accuracy and Evaluation of SVM Model
Accuracy using Score
Making the confusion matrix
Classification Report of ROC AUC and F1 Score value
